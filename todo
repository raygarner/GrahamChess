bugs
----
-> fails to make a move when game point changes
-> cant castle (since adding cant castle through check change)

----------
-> tweak weights of different elements
-> dont bring the queen out so early
-> deduction for doubled pawns
-> bonus for connected rooks
-> deduction for blocking pawns
-> make it like castling
-> mobility in danger function?

move searching
--------------
-> only search top x moves produced by makeEvalList
-> implement mobility in danger function?

main
----

-------------
-> print out current board
-> ask user for piece
