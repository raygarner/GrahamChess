TESTING

bugs
----
-> legal moves includes moves that leave the king in check. getValidTarget should make sure this doesnt happen

evaluation
----------
-> tweak weights of different elements

move searching
--------------
-> make it play mating move if one is detected

main
----
-> graham gets two moves in a row if a move mistake is made

user interface
-------------
-> print out current board
-> ask user for piece
-> ask user for move
-> convert that into a format that can be used by our functions
