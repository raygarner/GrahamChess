TESTING

move searching
--------------
-> make it play mating move if one is detected

user interface
-------------
-> print out current board
-> ask user for piece
-> ask user for move
-> convert that into a format that can be used by our functions

think of ways to add offensive capabilities (ie mating the opponent)
