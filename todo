-> tweak weights of different elements
-> dont bring the queen out so early
-> deduction for doubled pawns
-> bonus for connected rooks
-> deduction for blocking pawns

move searching
--------------
-> make it instantly play mating move if one is detected (this will fix first bug)

----
-> graham gets two moves in a row if a move mistake is made

-------------
-> print out current board
-> ask user for piece
-> ask user for move
