come up with a means of testing and test everything

remove validity attribute from type 'Move'?

function to check for an obstruction on a straight line path between two squares on the board

move validation functions for each piece

algorithm for the strength of a piece? I guess it would be split up into multiple functions
that could get the position of the piece and the actual material value of the piece and
combine them in some way.
