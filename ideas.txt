different evaluation algorithm depending on point in game? (opening, middlegame, endgame)
function to determine point in game? (opening, middlegame, endgame)

evaluation for a piece - which pieces it protects and which pieces it can take

function to find list of most important squares at one point in game?
(then check whether these squares are controlled/threatened)

new .hs file to call evaluation functions on each piece and create a evaluation number for a board position
This .hs file could be for the main recursive loop.

potential ideas to check if piece has moved at least one:
    read from text file
    negative position
    compound data type with ammount of moves made





pgn files for testing and proper lines
